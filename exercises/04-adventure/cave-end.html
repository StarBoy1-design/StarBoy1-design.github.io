        <h2>Cave Treasure Ending</h2>
        <p>
            You enter the cave, it's damp and humid. you feel as if you're being
            watched closely no matter what and the feeling never fades but as
            you step further in you find a mountain of gold and a church in the
            back filled with suplise to last years, but deep down you feel as if
            you can never return the way you came.
