        <h2>Never-Ending journey</h2>
        <p>
            You deicde to keep walking towards the city, you walk for days,
            weeks, months, you survive off of food  and water you find in 
            abandoned cars and spend your breaks using a radio to signal for
            help, but no matter what you do the same song plays on every
            frequincy "it's your move" by diana ross, but it seems distorted
            and breaks out every now in then. No matter how much you walk
            it seems you never make a dent in your trip, the city forever stays
            at an unreachable distance. always in sight but out of touch. You
            refuse to give up hope and continue to hike. <i>Just as endless as 
            the journey, is your will and determination to live and achieve 
            something as great as surving in this ruined world. You continue,
            forever more, never aging, never getting tierd, your will never
            wavering.</i>
