        <h2>Rescued ending</h2>
        <p>
            You decided to walk further into the forest hoping for good news
            soon, and it seems as if it's your lucky day. You arrive a cliff
            and look over the beautifle water and clear sky, in the distance
            you see tiny lights and it looks like a village. under the cliff
            you stand on you see a boat about to leave but they are still 
            packing.
