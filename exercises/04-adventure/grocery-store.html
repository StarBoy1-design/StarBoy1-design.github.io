        <h2>The Abandoned Grocery store</h2>
        <p>
            You decided you'd take a break from your journey and walk towards
            the light. You step past bushes but suddenly you fall through the
            floor?! you hit a hard surface and when you open your eyes
            after falling for an eternity... you realise you're in a old
            looking grocey store? The bright lit sign you above the exit reads
            "Jewel Osco". You walk around as it plays nice relaxing jazz over
            the speakers, the store is fully stocked, The floors are clean,
            and it seems as if it just closed, the white florescent lights buzz
            loudly, you approach the exit door but it dosent open, And no matter
            how long you wait, the sun <i>never</i> rises. You come to terms
            with your imprisionment. It's not so bad though.
