            You apporach the forest and you are greeted by instant chittering
            and scattering noises, you pay it no mind but as you walk deeper 
            the overgrowth of the forest gets worse and you come to a fork
            in the road, left seems as if the forest continues forever more,
            yet on your right is a dark cave seemingly looming a dark aura.
