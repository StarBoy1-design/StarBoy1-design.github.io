        <h2>You do...Nothing?</h2>
        <p>
            You decide niether, you relax in the cornfield, surronded by
            cute animals, overgrown corn, and utimatly a farm you use for
            shelter during the nightly hours. Everynight at 3:30 am the
            animals become restless down stares as you sleep on the top floor of
            the barn but you dont dare acknoledge it. Cause in your passing days
            you have found old vhs clips left by a past survivor who inhabited
            the farm, the last ever clip he went down stairs to confront the
            ruckus, but all you see before the clip ends is red eyes glowing in
            the dark, snarling. so everynight you ignore it. Aside from that
            life is rather peaceful.
