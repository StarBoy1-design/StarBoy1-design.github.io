                            Level 37, commonly referred to as the Poolrooms, is an 
                            expansive complex of interconnected rooms and corridors 
                            submerged in undulating, lukewarm water. Each area of 
                            the level varies greatly in size and structure, ranging 
                            rom uniform pools and hallways to more open, abnormally 
                            shaped areas. The majority of surfaces in the level are c
                            omposed of white, ceramic tiling, with the only deviation 
                            from this color being the blue-green hue of the water. 
                            The tiles are eerily pristine in condition, all identical 
                            to one another, without a single hint of damage on their 
                            shiny surfaces."

                            The End is a presumably infinite library composed of open areas 
                            and wide corridors. The building contains bookshelves, stands, 
                            and the usual apparatus of a normal library. Furniture is often 
                            positioned randomly, sometimes converging with one another or 
                            onnecting into the walls. The library is virtually devoid of 
                            books, leaving its shelves barren. Throughout the building, 
                            short texts and labels can be found meaninglessly placed on 
                            walls, commonly depicting the level's name. The level's 
                            condition is relatively poor, showing signs of temporal decay; 
                            its walls are seen to have cracks, and some shelves may 
                            collapse under slight pressure. The building's lights are 
                            faulty, occasionally flickering or sometimes shutting off 
                            temporarily.."

                            Leaving this Level is extremely difficult, due to the unstable 
                            nature of its geometry. For example, the Level seems to loop 
                            when walking in one direction. However, turning around at this 
                            point will cause you to run into a wall. Frequent random 
                            no-clipping has also been documented, but this does not 
                            result in exiting the Level. Exits do exist, but there is 
                            currently no way to document them. In addition, the Level 
                            can cause wanderers to be unable to perceive other wanderers, 
                            even if they are within extremely close proximity.

                            Large mall with retail stores inside spread across thousands of 
                            miles, reminiscent of a neon mall from the 1980s. The floor 
                            tiles are arranged in a pattern that varies in design. The 
                            fluorescent lights were positioned randomly, cast a variety 
                            of color tones, and produced a range of feelings for each 
                            color. Lights shine and cut at random times, and certain 
                            lights may be constantly off without shining again.
                            The air conditioners around the place made no noise but 
                            provided a breeze. A constant breeze blows through the air, 
                            causing temperatures to fluctuate; there is no warmth at all. 
                            The speakers release soothing music, yet the space is utterly 
                            silent, isolating the place for all time.
