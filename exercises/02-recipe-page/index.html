        <p>These garlic feta shawarma beef bowls are one of those meals that hit
             every craving at once. The ground beef is deeply spiced and saucy, 
             the garlic feta dressing is creamy and tangy, and everything comes 
             together perfectly over warm yellow rice. Simple ingredients, 
             big flavor, and exactly the kind of bowl I love making on repeat.

        <h2>Why You'll Love This Bowl</h2>
        <p>There’s a lot going on here in the best way.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The ground beef is juicy, deeply seasoned, and lightly saucy
        </li>
        <li>
            The garlic feta dressing is creamy, tangy, and packed with 
            flavor
        </li>
        <li>
            Every bite has contrast — warm rice, crisp lettuce, punchy 
            pickles.
        </li>
        <li>It’s filling without feeling heavy.</li>
        <li>
            Perfect for weeknights but impressive enough to serve to guests.
        </li>
        <p>
            This is one of those “better at home” bowls that tastes like 
            something you’d order out and immediately try to recreate.
        </p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>The Garlic Feta Dressing</h2>
        <p>This dressing deserves its own moment because it absolutely makes
                the bowl.
        </p>
        <p>To a blender, add minced garlic, water, olive oil, lemon juice, 
            feta, sugar, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, and salt to taste. 
            Blend until completely smooth and creamy. The texture should be 
            pourable but rich, almost like a loose sauce rather than a 
            thick dip.
        </p>
        <p> A few notes here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The feta adds saltiness and body, so always taste before 
                adding more salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                If it thickens too much in the fridge, a splash of water 
                loosens it right back up.
            </li>
            <li>
                This dressing is just as good on salads, roasted veggies, 
                or grilled chicken.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I usually make this first so it has time to chill while 
            everything else comes together.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Spiced Ground Beef</h2>
        <p>This ground beef is warm, aromatic, and layered with spices that 
            feel cozy without being overpowering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heat olive oil in a skillet, then add the ground beef and cook 
            until browned and broken up. Once the beef is cooked through, 
            stir in the spices — allspice, coriander, paprika, sumac, salt, 
            black pepper, and turmeric — making sure everything gets evenly 
            coated.
        </p>
        <p>
            To finish it off, whisk beef broth with cornstarch until smooth, 
            then pour it into the skillet. Let it simmer for a few minutes 
            until the beef becomes glossy, juicy, and lightly saucy. 
            This step makes a huge difference and keeps the beef from 
            drying out.
        </p>
        <p>The end result should be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tender</li>
            <li>Flavor-Packed</li>
            <li>Saucy but not soupy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exactly how you want it for a bowl situation.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Assembling The Bowls</h2>
        <p>This is where everything comes together.</p>
        <p>
            Start with a generous base of warm yellow rice, then spoon the 
            spiced ground beef right over the top. Add chopped lettuce for 
            crunch and chopped pickles for that tangy bite that cuts through 
            the richness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finish with a heavy drizzle of the garlic feta dressing — and 
            yes, heavy is encouraged here – along with a light drizzle of 
            pomegranate molasses just like an authentic shawarma wrap.
        </p>
        <p>If you want to go extra:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add more pickles</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little feta on top</li>
            <li>Finish with fresh herbs if you have them</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Make It Your Own</h2>
        <p>
            These bowls are super flexible while still keeping their 
            personality.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Swap yellow rice for basmati or jasmine rice</li>
            <li>
                Use ground chicken or turkey if that’s what you have 
                (just add a little extra oil).
            </li>
            <li>Add tomatoes or cucumbers for more freshness</li>
            <li>Turn it into a wrap situation with warm flatbread</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Storage & Leftovers</h2>
    
        <p>Store each component separately in airtight containers in the 
            fridge for up to 3 days.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Beef reheats best on the stovetop or microwave with a
                    splash of water.
            </li>
            <li>Dressing keeps well and thickens slightly when chilled.</li>
            <li>Assemble fresh so everything stays crisp and balanced</li>                </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
